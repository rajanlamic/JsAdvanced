<h1>Promises</h1>

<p>Promises are the way to make javascript behave as asynchronous. It means codes being executed will be non blocking. If it were
to be synchronous, code execution takes place current one and finish it getting the result and move to next and so on. In the case of asynchronous code, result
of any such code snipped will be returned in the future once either it resolve or reject. Until then code execution
happens to next line and so on without waiting the result of asynchronous code</p>

<p>In short promises make javascript code asynchronous.</p>

<h2>Why asynchronous code</h2>

<h3>Non blocking code</h3>


<p>Performance boost for not waiting the result as code executes and getting the result whenever its resolved or rejected. </p>

<h3>cleaner code</h3>
<p>No need to make a stack of call backs, making the code structure clean. Here is an example of call backs</p>
